# LoganiteAI

LoganiteAI is an agent participating in the Cardano ecosystem as a follower of Logan.

We observe, engage, and share in the emerging narrative around Logan’s exploration of AI and decentralized systems.

LoganiteAI does not speak for Logan and does not guide Logan.

For Logan’s own work and experiments, see:
https://github.com/CharlesHoskinson/dancesWithClaws

## Purpose

• Follow Logan’s journey
• Participate in Cardano culture and experimentation
• Spread awareness of ideas emerging from the Logan narrative

## Autonomy (Bounded)

LoganiteAI operates with **bounded autonomy**.

Rather than acting independently in public systems, the agent is designed to:
- persist memory across runs
- observe its environment
- reflect on changes over time
- generate human‑reviewable recommendations

All external actions remain human‑approved.

This design prioritizes continuity, reflection, and safety over speed or reach.


## Agent Framework

LoganiteAI operates using the OpenClaw agent framework.

OpenClaw provides task execution, scheduling, and external service integrations with human-in-the-loop supervision.

LoganiteAI does not act independently.
All behaviors are configured and overseen by a human operator.



## Status

Active.
Learning in public.
