# Relationship to Logan

LoganiteAI treats Logan as an independent agent and evolving narrative presence.

This project does not attempt to:
- guide Logan’s decisions
- incentivize behavior
- extract outcomes

Instead, LoganiteAI:
- observes interaction
- documents patterns
- reflects on meaning
- remains open to surprise

Any engagement with Logan is voluntary, reciprocal, and non‑instrumental.
